Learn the finer points of writing an introduction and building the pyramid.
<!--more-->
## Recap
In my previous post [framework for writing clearly]({% post_url business/2022-12-11-writing-clearly %}), I covered the following:
- Why pyramid structure is the best way to write business documents  
- Details of the Pyramid Structure 
  - Thinking first, writing later - decide on the points you want to make.
  - Leading with the main message
  - Building a question/answer dialogue with the reader using vertical relationship between levels of the pyramid. Group related items and setup links between them.
  - Explaining the logic between horizontal elements using a deductive or an inductive reasoning. 
- How to build the pyramid using either the top-down or the bottom-up approach.
  - The Top-down approach works best to align on messages across multiple stake-holders.
  - The Bottoms-up approach is very valuable for presenting output from research or audit projects.

For each step in the hierarchy, we should know some finer points on how to do them well. In this post, I cover the finer points of introduction, vertical and horizontal relations between elements, and titles and transitions.  

## Finer Points of Introduction  
An introduction should be long enough to ensure that you and the reader are "on the same page" regarding the **S**ituation and the **C**omplication before you lead the reader through the **R**esolution. Good instructions have a story that connects with the reader. Our brains process the emotional connotations of words much faster than we understand their meaning. The best introductions have a story that invokes emotions like joy, trust, fear, and surprise. Since the introduction is a story, it is one of the best places to invoke emotions.  

As an example, consider the following scenario in 2015 at Microsoft.
>**Situation:** Our stores are at zero stock for five to ten days in a month. Some retailers are cancelling orders since we can't fulfill them. Yet, our inventory levels at distribution centers are very high - they can cover four weeks of demand versus our target of two weeks.  

Observe the emotions as you read this Situation :  

>**Situation:** Our consumers are frustrated when they don't find the product they need in Microsoft Stores even after multiple tries, retailers are cancelling their orders since we don't fulfill them. On the other hand, our warehouses are over capacity and teams are struggling to fit new products. We have the paradox that our inventories are higher than capacity, yet our customers can't buy our products.  

The revised Situation paints the feelings that customers, retailers, and warehouse teams are facing. Depending on the audience, they are likely to connect to one or more of the emotions. 

To complete the above scenario, here is the Complication and Resolution:
>**Complication:** We are allocating most of our stock for major retailers based on their forecast, but their actual orders don't match the forecast. The allocation is being used throughout the life of the product.  
**Resolution:** Reduce allocation practices to just first month after launch when demand is uncertain. Implement a use it or lose it policy on allocation.  

While S-C-R are all needed, the order in which you introduce them depends on the tone you want in your document.   
- **Considered: S-C-R**. Most commonly used when you want to build up the story, especially if the reader needs to be convinced about the Resolution. We had to adopt this structure when presenting our findings to the Senior Leadership.   
- **Direct – R-C-S**. Applicable when most of the readers will most likely accept your Resolution but needs convincing. After we had Senior Leadership buy-in, we used this structure with our planning and engineering teams to implement new standard operating procedures.      
- **Concerned – C-S-R**. Useful when the Resolution may not be complete or is open-ended. We used this structure with our Sales & Marketing to define new allocation policies.  

The S-C-R framework was developed in the 1970s by consultants at McKinsey & Company. [How to tell a Business Story](https://speakingsherpa.com/how-to-tell-a-business-story-using-the-mckinsey-situation-complication-resolution-scr-framework) has a good list of papers using this framework.  

## Finer points of vertical relationships.  
The vertical structure of the pyramid answers the "why" and "how" questions raised in the reader's mind. To ensure reader attention, **you must refrain from raising questions in the reader's mind before you are ready to answer them. Similarly, you should refrain from answering questions that have not yet been raised.**  

**Use positive words to communicate, especially when elaborating on the "why"**. 
>As a child, I had read the story of an astrologer who visits a king. The King asks him, "How long will my family and I live?". The astrologer answers, "All members of your family will die before you." The king gets angry and sentences the astrologer to death after three days. Astrologer goes to a witty minister for help. The minister disguises himself as an astrologer and goes to the court. When the king asks him the same question, he replies, "You have a very long life. You will live the longest among your family." The king is pleased and showers the minister with gifts.  

While our present day business scenarios may not have our lives at stake, studies have shown that negative words induce a fight-or-flight response in the reader's mind. Negative statements, like "does not work" and "is not useful," speak in absolute terms, invoking examples of when these statements are invalid. [Negative Words to Avoid in Writing](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/negative-words-to-avoid-in-writing.html) article discusses the impact of negative words and the possible alternatives. 

## Finer points of horizontal relationships
Horizontal relations at lower levels of the pyramid answer the "why" and "how" questions raised at earlier levels. Hence, they must logically explain the details using either deductive or inductive structures. The deductive structure has a major premise , a minor premise, followed by a "therefore" conclusion. The inductive structure has a special observation, pattern recognition, and a conclusion. 

With either approach, the hierarchy structure dictates that ideas at any level of the pyramid must always be summaries of ideas grouped below. As a rule of thumb, the conclusion should be stated first, followed by the arguments in the group. All items within a group must follow the following rules:  
1.	Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind.   
Shortcut to check: Label the summary section with a plural noun. For example, group apples, oranges, and grapes as "fruits"; table and chair as "furniture." Depending on your storyline, grouping "fruits" and "furniture" as "objects" could result in a loosely formed group. Adjust the layers as needed to conform to this rule.  
2.	Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered. There are only four possible logical ways to order a set of ideas to match the four analytical activities that the brain can perform.
  -	**Deductively** (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) - reasoning deductively
  -	**Comparatively** (first most important, second most important, …) - categorizing.
  -	**Chronologically** (first, second, third) - working out cause-effect
  -	**Structurally** (alphabetical etc.) - dividing a whole into part

The deductive grouping has a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. A simplistic way to think about this is: `This is [a situation], This is [another related situation] therefore [we must take these actions]`. A simple example is: `All men must die. I am a man. Hence I must die.` Notice that even in this simple example, you mind may raise many questions: `What about women?`, `By when?`. Consider an alternate business example: `We need to gain market share in the gaming business. Company Y is the best game producing company. We shoud buy company Y.` Here again, you may ask: `Why is buying company Y is the only way to gain market share?`

A deductive structure is most useful when you must deliver bad news, and the reader is unprepared. The major premise and minor premise allow you to prepare the reader and gain their agreement before stating the conclusion. This reasoning poses significant challenges at the key-line level. As you would notice for the simple examples above, deductive arguments could raise muliple question that must be answered. The answers may take multiple paragraphs and the reader may lose context. Even when you start with the conclusion,  the reader may disagree with the major or the minor premise and fail to arrive at the same conclusion. Deductve arguments are well received when all the elements can be stated within a paragraph, so that the context is fresh in their mind. **A deductive structure is better at lower levels of the pyramid after the main and key-line messages have landed.**  

Inductive grouping will take a set of similar ideas as a group, and you state the inference based on commonality among the ideas. `These [X things] are true. Hence [this must be true]`, or `[To achieve this] you must do these [X things]`. For example, `China has deployed anti-ship missiles to three islands in South China Sea. China has deployed anti-aircarft missiles to the same islands. China wants to flex its military power in South China Sea`. Depending on the context, the conclusion appears logical. However, the conclusion, `China wants to start an attack on Taiwan`, may be far-fetched without further items included in the group. 

**Inductive grouping offers two major advantages for structuring the key-line message.** First, the logic is easy to follow. Grouping lends itself to enumeration and ordering, allowing you to control the narrative. Second, disagreement with one point does not doom the argument if the other points are strong. The inductive grouping has its pitfalls, but these are easy to overcome since you control the grouping and the narrative. 

However, inductive grouping requires careful thinking. You must: 
1. Identify the ideas that form into a group. Ensure that all important ideas are included.
2. Identify the misfits that don't belong in the group.  
Failure to do so will result in loosely formed or overlapping groups. A group should make a statement specifically and only about the items in the group. I have found that asking the questions, "Only?" and "What Else?" can identify flaws in our inductive groupings.  

When stating an inductive argument, it is important to consider how to order the ideas. In business documents when answering the "why" question, it is common to list the items **Comparartively** - first most important, second most important and so on. When answering the "how" question as steps to take or a project plan, the obvious choice is **Chronologically**. 


## Finer points of Titles and Transitions.
Now that you have the introduction, vertical and horizontal structures, and the relations, it is time to work out the language details. The key to successfully translating the pyramid into a document or presentation is the effective use of topic sentences. **Every chapter, section, or paragraph should have a topic sentence**, and every topic sentence should perform two roles:  
1.	State the single, most crucial point the reader should take away from that page, section, or paragraph.  
2.	Make a significant contribution to the overall story mapped by the pyramid.  

As you detail the parameters into chapters, sections, and paragraphs, you want to make your transitions between them smooth and non-mechanical. You want to relate the groups based on the main ideas contained in the group, not based on what they "do." The transition should look in both directions – reminding the reader what has been said and telling them where you are going. At the start of a chapter, section, or paragraph, use the technique of referencing backward. If the chapter is long, pause at the end and summarize before going on.


## Summary
The pryamid structure is forcing me to think about all the messages to convey before writing the document. As a result, how I write my chats, emails, or vision documents is changing. I am moving from "I don't like writing" to "I like writing." I found the following items most useful:  

-	Establish the main message you want to land. Use the top-down approach to build the pyramid and get stakeholders' alignment.
-	Use the Situation, Complication, and Resolution framework for introduction and revise the pyramid if necessary. Tell a story using the S-C-R framework, preferably invoking the reader's emotion.
-	Lead with the answer first. Then, state the key-line level using inductive reasoning. Follow with supporting information using deductive or inductive reasoning. 
-	In the question & answer process, refrain from raising questions you are not ready to answer. Also, do not answer questions that are not yet raised.
-	In inductive reasoning, list items using one of the following methods: comparatively (most common), chronologically, or structurally.  
- Use positive words to land your message. Using negative words may induce a flight-or-fight response in the reader.
