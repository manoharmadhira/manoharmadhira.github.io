Theory of constraints principles came in handy to make the most of the 200 km biking trip across the Netherlands despite many challenges. 
<!--more-->
The Netherlands is the biking capital of the world. While planning for the vacation, we read that the country [is flat as a pancake](https://aboutthenetherlands.com/is-the-netherlands-the-flattest-country-in-the-world/#:~:text=The%20lowest%20point%20of%20the%20Netherlands%2C%20Zuidplaspolder%2C%20is,a%20pancake%20with%20little%20blips%20here%20and%20there.), and the climate in August is [mild and reasonably dry](https://www.weather2visit.com/europe/netherlands/amsterdam-august.htm). For us bike lovers, this reads as a dream destination. So, in June, my wife and I made plans to ride 200 km in the first week of August with our son and nephew.

We are no strangers to biking. My wife, son, and I have completed 160 km per day trips, and our nephew has been riding everywhere for the past year. Coming from the Seattle area, we are accustomed to riding in the rain and riding on the hills. Riding in reasonably dry weather on a flat land sounded like music.  

But as the days got closer, the weather forecast changed the chance of precipitation from 7% to 56%. On the actual ride, we had to factor in 30-50 km/hr headwinds and multiple flat tires (punctures). Initially, the trip felt less than the ideal we dreamed of.  

By applying the learnings from the Theory of Constraints both during planning and execution, we were able to make the most of the trip. In this blog, I will share the application, learning, and how to transfer these to product development, project execution, and leadership actions.

## Time buffers are important ...
While planning our stay in Haarlem, we decided on the most critical sites to visit and the activities to do. However, we did not make a time-based schedule. This approach allowed us to enjoy the beautiful rustic Haarlem. Sorry, I am getting ahead of myself. Let me rewind and describe our ride.

We started our bike ride from Amsterdam on the first day at 1:00 p.m. Amsterdam to Haalem was the shortest of our rides, only 26 km. We estimated a leisurely two-hour ride after discounting our biking speeds to account for the load and stops. After picking up our rental bikes, we rode 2 km to Amsterdam Centraal and saw the amazing under canal bike parking garage. The Netherlands is genuinely the biking capital of the world.

Amsterdam was preparing for the pride festival. With the large crowd, there was extra debris on the road. We carefully weaved our way through. However, a piece of glass found its way into our bike tire, a heavy downpour started, and our hearts sank. We had barely covered 2 km, had a flat tire, and felt wet. Since we were so close, we returned to the rental location to fix the flat tire. Finally, we started our journey back at 2:30 p.m. A one-and-a-half-hour delay in a two-hour ride, yikes!

On the second trial, the first hour was uneventful. We enjoyed a breeze from the moderate wind and saw our first windmill. The mild weather changed to torrential rain and a 20 km/hr headwind for 30 minutes. Our pace dropped by 50%. We hit the trifecta with another flat tire and finally had to walk our bikes. We reached our destination at 6:30 p.m. instead of the planned 3:00 p.m.  

Once we reached Haarlem, our rough planning paid off. We adjusted the activity order based on the current availability. In project planning terminology, we had not made a time-based schedule upfront. We had assigned a forced priority to our activities and adjusted the execution as certainty increased. If we had not provided time buffers for our travel and booked the tours based on our initial estimate, we would have had an immense challenge.

## ... So are Capacity buffers  
As mentioned, we got a flat tire about 5 km before reaching Haarlem. The "flat as a pancake land" did not help. We could see grass all around us no trees to shelter under. The bike shops in the vicinity had closed at 5:00 p.m. The torrential rain made it difficult to find the puncture spot. Running out of options, we decided to split. My wife and I transferred all the luggage onto our bikes. The boys were to walk their bikes without having to lug the luggage. They made the best of the time enjoying the picture perfect rural landscape.


What has all this got to do with capacity buffers? General wisdom says we are most efficient when people or machines work at or near capacity. In fact percentage utilization is still a key metric in many factories in measuring operations. 

If my wife and I had biked to our full capacity, we would not have been able take on our son's and nephew's bags that added 50%-75% weight. The capacity buffer allowed us to share load from each other when needed allowing us to complete the trip in 2.5 hours despite the setbacks. If the fastest rider had gone at his speed, the person with the flat tire would have reached much later. Since we were together all the time - decision-making and changing course as needed became simpler.

Capacity buffers are important in all operations, people dependent operations like software development, or machine dependent operations like manufacturing. In the **The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt** Alex realizes that if each machine in a plant is working at highest efficiency (output over capacity), then the plant will have very low throughput - the final output produced per hour.


## Constraints Management
In the **The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt**, Eli introduced the five focusing steps of the Theory of Constraints for driving ongoing improvement. The five steps are:
1. Identify the constraint
2. Exploit the constraint  
3. Subordinate everything to the constraint
4. Elevate the constraint
5. Prevent inertia from becoming the constraint

Our group aimed to cover the distance in the shortest possible time while enjoying the pleasures of biking. My wife and son rode hybrid bikes with carriers, I rode a leisure bike with carriers, and our nephew rode a mountain bike and carried a backpack. We rode in a formation - with our son leading the group, followed by my wife, me, and our nephew. 

The formation was based on the following rationale and assumption: 

1. Identify the constraint: My wife bikes the slowest. So, she would be our constraint (I have her permission to say so). We ensured she had an efficient bike and didn't overload her bags. 
2. Exploit the constraint: Our son riding just ahead of her reduced the amount of headwind hitting her.
3. Subordinate everything to the constraint: Everyone followed the pace set by my wife. Son would maintain just ahead of her. He would turn or call out to check and control his speed accordingly.

Of course, in this case, we could not elevate the constraint. We made good progress on the first day and some part of the second day with this formation. 

About 25% of the way between Haarlem and The Hague, we again faced torrential rain, 50 km/hr headwind, and some "hills". I say "hills" in quotes, because Seattlelites will laugh at 600 ft elevation gain over 30 km to be called hills. However, with the trifecta, the elevation gain, the headwind and the rain, these hills felt like mountains.

The more I tried to fight the trifecta, the more I fell further behind. The distance between my wife and me kept on increasing. I failed to acknowledge and accept that I was now the constraint. As we do in every insane decision, I justified why I was riding the leisure bike loaded with heavy items and not given to my son who clearly has highest capacity buffer. I had erred while reserving three hybrid bikes, so I was responsible for getting the leisure bike instead of a hybrid<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>.  I also had a lot more capacity than my wife. So, indeed, I could carry the extra load. Due to my ego and faulty assumptions, we lost valuable time. 

I had let inertia set in and refused to acknowledge that the constraint had changed. After covering 30 km in three hours, I conceded and agreed to elevate the new constraint (me). I asked our son to take over the leisure bike for the last 16 km. The hybrid bicycle improved my speed, and we covered the final 16 km in less than one hour.  

So, to improve velocity, find the constraint blocking the throughput of a unit or organization. Do everything you can to help this constraint to produce more of the desired output. Note that the constraint can be people, machines or policies. 


## Start-Stop is worse than slow pace
On the third day, the ride was pleasant. An occasional shower, flat terrain, and beautiful scenes - everything we had hoped for. Yet, we were not achieving our regular velocity. We were stopping more frequently as a group. The stops were not "good stops" - those we take to enjoy the scenery or rest. These were "bad stops" - the ones that delayed our progress. There were two main reasons.    

### Checking for direction.
The Netherlands has an excellent system for bike routes. The [numbered cycle network](https://holland-cycling.com/tips-and-info/finding-your-way/numbered-cycle-network) is a grid of bicycle-friendly routes connected by numbers. The numbers are called *knooppunten* or junction points. Each path has signs indicating the way to the next junction. This simple system is very effective. You don't need GPS or a map. Just list the junction numbers for your desired route and follow the signs.  

Sometimes, the junction sign may be missing. Sometimes, a tree or branch could block the sign. Occasionally, one of us might have misread the sign. So every time one of us doubted, we would pause, discuss, and sometimes go back to check or use GPS to try and get back on route.  

A simple rule fixed this issue. The leader would always call out the direction after seeing each sign, even if the route said straight. This rule gave us two advantages: 1) our false stops for checking direction reduced drastically since people behind knew that the leader was sure of the direction, and 2) when the leader made a mistake, we would catch it sooner and minimize the waste.


### Waiting for others
For our nephew, this was the first multi-day bike ride. Combine that with extra capacity and a love for photography, he would halt frequently. We would not always notice his halt when riding in the earlier formation of *our son, wife, me, our nephew*. Once one of us saw, we would all stop as a group till our nephew caught up. The stops delayed us as a group since my wife was forced to make "bad stops", when she didn't need to stop.

We reordered our formation as *our son, wife, nephew, me*. Now, whenever our nephew stopped, I was aware. Thanks to the hybrid bike, I had gained extra capacity. I could ride at a pace such that my son or wife could see me while still waiting for my nephew to reach me. When my nephew came to me, we rode fast and caught up to the group.

This approach avoided slowing the constraint down, and we made good time. No more "bad stops", just the "good stops", like stopping for cheese in Gouda.

## Appreciate the tailwind
I like riding in a loop vs. an out-and-back ride. So, if the wind direction is consistent during the ride, we would experience both the head and tailwinds. In our journey, this happened on the fourth day we travelled from Rotterdam to Gouda. Our nephew asked me, "What happened to all the wind?" I replied, "It is now tailwind. Notice that we are riding about 50% faster." This question was not an exception. It has been asked almost every time in my last ten years of long-distance riding. We fail to notice the wind when it is helping us.

In life, like in the bike ride, let us take the time to identify and thank the tailwinds that are helping us move forward quickly.



## Summary
In summary, to improve velocity, strategically place time and capacity buffers around the constraint. Ensure that constraints time is not wasted by unnecessary waits and working on the wrong stuff. And, finally, always take the time to identify and appreciate the tailwinds.

Thank you to my wife, son, and nephew for a wonderful, memorable trip. In my life I have been fortunate to be constantly supported by family, friends, colleagues, and mentors who have been my tailwinds.

## Notes:
<a name="note1">1</a>: For those new to biking, leisure bikes are heavier. They have just seven gears, compared to 21 to 27 gears in a hybrid or mountain bike. These bikes also set the posture for short-distance rides rather than long-distance rides. Thus, leisure bikes are best suited for short city rides, but fail to perform on a long-distance rides.
