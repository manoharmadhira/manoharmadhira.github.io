Writing is an essential skill in business to communicate our ideas, get buy-in, and bring people together. I am sharing the lessons I have learnt over the years on how to write better.
<!--more-->
As a Product Manager, I often write documents for different purposes like communicating our vision to our customers, communicating customer needs to the engineering teams, communicating status to our executives, or obtaining buy-in from stakeholders. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy writing. Writing is an arduous endeavor for me, and I often dread creating documents.

Over the years, I have strived to learn how to write clearly by improving on writing more straightforward sentences and learning how to structure the document to drive clarity. In this blog, I cover the Why and How to build an easy to understand document structure using [The Pyramid Principle by Barbara Minto](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Present-Thinking-Clearly-dp-0273659030/dp/0273659030/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) ,and include learning on the job from my successes and failures. I cover details in how to convert the structure to words in [Finer points for writing clearly]({% post_url business/2022-12-12-finer-points-of-writing-clearly %}). 

## What is clear writing? 
Clear writing aims to get the writer's point across to the reader. Writing clearly can mean two things:  
- Writing simple and direct sentences.  
- Structuring the document to drive clarity.  

Writing simple, direct sentences or overlong, unwieldy sentences is a matter of style. Improving these needs a mastery of language and rigorous practice. I still struggle with these elements and end up writing long sentences, using passive voice, or using technical jargon. Thankfully, tools like [Microsoft Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-editor) and [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com), built with artificial intelligence, help to find and correct these style errors. 

**Writing clearly is more about organizing ideas than writing words**. Document structure and the order of sentences are the most important to drive clarity. These issues are far more pervasive but easier to correct. To get the point across to the reader, **it is best to structure the document in a top-down pyramid giving the sequence of topics and establishing their relation**. To explore why this structure works the best, let us delve into how the brain works. 

The human brain is conditioned to establish relations, group information together, and hold limited information about each group. Unrelated statements can be hard to understand. As the sentences unfold, the mind tries to establish relationships with the previous statement. If it finds the relation, it stores the summary of the relationship. If the new sentence is not related, it creates a new category.  

The human brain has a limit on how much information it can hold. George A. Miller, an American psychologist who was one of the founders of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, states that the **magic number of items the brain can keep in memory is seven, plus or minus two**. Some brains can hold higher or lower. It is safer to target three items.  

While there is a limit to how many parallel items a brain can store, it can retrieve information in a hierarchy. Since the mind groups and holds information, it can also "unfold" the details as it reaches the groups. So, the brain thinks hierarchically in a tree/pyramid structure.

Knowing the way the brain can unfold details and the limits on the amount of information it can hold, **a safe bet for clear writing is:**  
1. to group related information into groups of three to five and  
2. to set up links between all the items.  

This inevitably means you should use a top-down approach to present a sequence of topics, establish the relation, and control the sequence in which you present your ideas. The reader will look for the structure connecting ideas as they come in. To ensure the reader finds the relation you intend, you must tell them in advance what it is.  

To write clearly, you must: 1) decide the points you want to make and 2) put them into words. That is, think first, write later. This process would also a) cut down the writing time, b) increase clarity, and c) decrease the length. In a group setting with multiple co-authors, aligning on the points you want to make before you put down the words reduces the time taken to arrive at an agreement and to create a coherent document.  

## The Pyramid Principle  
The brain's hierarchical information storage dictates that "writing clearly" follows a pyramid. 
The pyramid rests on two principles:  
1.	Every document can and should be reduced to a single main message.
2.	You should state this message as soon as possible, immediately after a short and suitably structured introduction.  

Success in "writing clearly" requires embracing both of these principles. In his excellent book on storytelling, [The Invisible Ink,](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Ink-Practical-Building-Resonate/dp/0998534471/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=invisible+ink+brian+mcdonald&qid=1671688566&sprefix=invisible+ink+brian+%2Caps%2C1309&sr=8-1) Brain McDonald calls the main message **the armature**. The armature is the skeleton on which the whole document or story stands. Without the structure, the body collapses. **In business writing**, unlike storytelling, **it is better to lead with the main message** so that the reader is not left in suspense.  

We often feel uncomfortable accepting the second principle of telling the message as soon as possible. We feel compelled to use an alternate structure of walking the reader through the analytical process that led to the answer. This alternate structure has two flaws. First, the reader must wait until the end to get the main message. Many readers may run out of steam before reaching the end. Second, redundancy and repetition are inevitable in this structure. We will need to summarize findings frequently and return to the first areas to present conclusions. This starting, stopping, and starting forces repetition for the writer and places a cognitive load on the reader, causing impatience and inattentiveness.  

The pyramid avoids both of the issues with the alternate structure above. It reflects the distinction between the analysis process and communicating the results. **To analyze, we think up, working from raw material to the main message. To express, we write down, from the main message to the detail**. 

The Pyramid Principle is applicable in all fields. Consider the following phone conversation with my doctor's assistant a few weeks ago:
> **Doctor's assistant:** *Manohar, you remember that we had to collect a second blood sample from you last week. Even though the first sample had shown everything was ok, we wanted to double check. Thank you for coming in again. We have now received the result from your second blood sample.*  
At this point my heart is racing and my mind is going through multiple questions, *did the second sample show something wrong? Is everything alright?*  
**Doctor's assistent continues:** *Thankfully, the results are ok with the second sample also. So you are clear.*  
**Consider the alternative message:** *Manohar, happy to tell you that your second blood sample results also show everything is ok. Thank you for coming a second time, we just wanted to be sure.*  

Starting with the answer gets the message across faster and prepares the reader for the details.

## The Pyramid Structure 
In the pyramid, **you lead with the answer – the main message.** You expand the pyramid vertically by answering the **why** and **how** questions raised in the reader's mind and explain your logic horizontally using deductive or inductive arguments. Thus, the elements in the pyramid have both a vertical and horizontal relationship. The first level of hierarchy from the main message is the key-line level. At this level, you must cover the "why" of the main message. Lower levels serve the details supporting the key-line levels. The pyramid should be preceded by an introduction, describing what the reader will get and why they should care. 

The vertical relationship between levels in the pyramid reveals items in a question/answer format. For each statement or topic, the reader's mind constantly raises the "Why?" and "How?" questions. Hence the question/answer format should cover the "Why?" and "How?" from the previous level. **When both "Why" and "How" questions are likely, first answer the "Why" and then the "How".** Nobody cares how to do something unless they are convinced of its value.

The horizontal relationship follows deductive or inductive reasoning for all elements at the same level of the pyramid. The question/answer format dictates that the details at the following line of the hierarchy must logically answer the questions raised by the previous level. Hence these elements must be related with either a deductive structure or an inductive structure. The deductive structure has a major premise, a minor premise, followed by a "therefore" conclusion. The inductive structure has a special observation, pattern recognition, and a conclusion. This structure lends itself to grouping. I will cover the use of these structures in the [How to Build the Pyramid](#how-to-build-the-pyramid) section and a detailed explanation in [Finer points of writing clearly]({% post_url business/2022-12-12-finer-points-of-writing-clearly %}).

Writing an introduction is necessary because the reader is only interested in reading your document and knowing what you will tell them if they feel the need to do so. The introduction is the most important part to capture the reader's attention and motivate them to read further. To connect with the reader, the best way to write an introduction is to tell a story. Every good story has a beginning (the Situation), a middle (the Complication), and an end (the Resolution). The Resolution should be your main message which is then explained by the pyramid structure using a question/answer dialogue.  

{% include show-image.html src="/assets/img/blog/pyramid_structure_intro.jpg" caption="Created by author using PowerPoint" alt="Image of pyramid structure with introduction" %}

An exciting implication of the question/answer dialogue is that it eliminates any logical need for a conclusion. Logically speaking, there is no more to say once all questions have been answered. But a conclusion creates a sense of closure; without it, we would have no place for the inevitable Next Steps. So you may summarize the key-points and include next steps at the end. Nonetheless, there is no such thing as a structured conclusion.  

You can apply the pyramid principle to day-to-day chats and emails as well. Notice the leading with main message, and the importance of order in this dialog with Laura:
>**Laura:** *I have a question on "Field A" in System A. Is it equivalent to "Field B" in system B?*  
**My first draft:** *Yes, they are the same. There could be marginal differences in counts between systems due to the time when systems refresh, but both systems source data from the same field in System C.*  
When I reviewed the draft, I found that although I had answered the first question, the following statement called out differences, then I switched back to saying they are same. So Laura would have to read: **same, different, and same**. Secondly, I drew attention to the less critical element – the minor differences - first.  
**Revised response:** *Yes, they are the same. Both systems source data from the same field in System C. There could be marginal differences in the counts due to system refresh delays.*    
 
With the revised response, Laura could stop after the first or second statement and still obtain the complete picture. She also would not need to context switch between similar and different data.


## How to Build the Pyramid?
Now that we understand the importance and basic structure of the contents, a question arises, what is the best way to build them? Unlike physical pyramids, structured document pyramids can be created using either the top-down or the bottom-up approach.  

In most cases, **you should try the top-down approach first**. In a top-down approach, you think first, write later. This approach allows multiple stakeholders co-authoring a document to align on the messages before creating content. By focusing on the messages first, the approach reduces the tendency to showcase all the work done by each team. A top-down approach avoids the "get it all down" syndrome in both the single and the multiple-author scenarios. Once we write something down, it is difficult to delete. *We love what we have created, no matter how disjointed the thinking.*  

{% include show-image.html src="/assets/img/blog/pyramid_howto.jpg" caption="Created by author using PowerPoint" alt="Image of How to build the pyramid" %}

For a top-down approach, you can use the following steps:  
1.	Write the Subject you are discussing.
2.	Visualize the reader. What question in their mind about the Subject would you answer when you have finished writing?
3.	In the top box of the pyramid, write the answer or the resolution - the main message.
4.	Now think through the introduction. Identify the Situation. What does the reader already know about the Subject? What are the other undisputable facts on the Subject?
5.	Develop the Complication. Ask, "So What?" What has changed in the stable Situation? What happened in the Situation to trigger the Question?
6. Recheck the Question and Answer – the Complication statement should immediately raise the Question. If not, rethink and adjust as needed.
7.	What new question is raised by the answer?
8.	How will you answer it? Will you use Deductive reasoning or Inductive reasoning?
9.	Repeat the question-answer process to structure the support points.  

The bottoms-up approach is very valuable for presenting output from research or audit projects. In my experience, this approach takes longer, especially when multiple groups are involved, because it is challenging to decide what to cut. 
1.	List out all the points – problems, solutions, findings
2.	Work out the relations. The relations must fit one of the four analytical activities the brain can perform: working out cause and effect, dividing a whole into parts, categorizing, and reasoning deductively. 
3.	Draw the conclusions – the Situation, the Complication, the Question, and the Answer. Recheck the question and answer – the Complication statement should immediately raise the Question. If it does not, rethink and adjust.  
4.  Think through the top-down approach and verify that vertical structure raises and answers the "Why" and "How" questions.

Use the S-C-R (**S**ituation-**C**omplication-**R**esolution) framework to think through the introduction. Limit the introduction to what the reader will readily agree is true. Always put the historical chronology in the introduction. **What happened should not be in the body. The body should hold only ideas.**  

## Summary
The pryamid structure is forcing me to think about all the messages to convey before writing the document. As a result, how I write my chats, emails, or vision documents is changing. I am moving from "I don't like writing" to "I like writing." I find the following items most useful:  

-	Establish the main message you want to land. Use the top-down approach to build the pyramid and get stakeholders' alignment.
-	Use the Situation, Complication, and Resolution framework for introduction and revise the pyramid if necessary. Tell a story using the S-C-R framework.
-	Lead with the answer. Then, state the key-line messages and provide the supporting details. Establish a question/answer dialog with the reader, controlling the sequence of the ideas. 

For each step in the hierarchy, we should know some finer points on how to do them well. I cover these in [Finer Points of Writing Clearly]({% post_url business/2022-12-12-finer-points-of-writing-clearly %}).
