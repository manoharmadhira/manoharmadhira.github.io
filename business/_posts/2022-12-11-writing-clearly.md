As a Product Manager, I often write documents for different purposes like communicating our vision to our customers, communicating customer needs to the engineering teams, communicating status to our executives, or obtaining buy-in from stakeholders. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy writing. Writing is an arduous endeavor for me, and I often dread creating documents.

Over the years, I have strived to learn how to write clearly by improving on writing more straightforward sentences and learning how to structure the document to drive clarity.  

Writing simple, direct sentences or overlong, unwieldy sentences is a matter of style. Improving these needs a mastery of language and rigorous practice. I still struggle with these elements and end up writing long sentences, using passive voice, or using technical jargon. Thankfully, tools like Microsoft Editor and Grammarly, built with artificial intelligence, help to find, and correct these style errors. 

Structuring the document to drive clarity is easier to learn and implement. In this blog, I cover the main learnings from the book, [The Pyramid Princple by Barbara Minto](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Present-Thinking-Clearly-dp-0273659030/dp/0273659030/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), along with other training and learning on the job from my successes and failures.  

## What is clear writing? 
Clear writing aims to get the writer's point across to the reader. To understand how to do so, it is important to know how the brain works. 

The human brain is conditioned to establish relations, group information together, and hold limited information about each group. Unrelated statements can be hard to understand. As the sentences unfold, the mind tries to establish relationships with the previous statement. If it finds the relation, it stores the summary of the relationship. If the new sentence is not related, it creates a new category.  

The human brain has a limit on how much information it can hold. George A. Miller, an American psychologist who was one of the founders of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, states that the **magic number of items the brain can keep in memory is seven, plus or minus two**. Some brains can hold higher or lower. It is safer to target three items.  

While there is a limit to how many parallel items a brain can store, it can retrieve information in a hierarchy. Since the mind groups and holds information, it can also "unfold" the details as it reaches the groups. So, the brain thinks hierarchically in a tree/pyramid structure.  

Knowing the way the brain can unfold details and the limits on the amount of information it can hold, a safe bet for clear writing is  
1. to group related information into groups of three to five and  
2. to set up links between all the items.  

This inevitably means using a top-down approach to give the sequence of topics and establish the relation between them. You also need to control the sequence in which you present your ideas. The reader will look for the structure connecting ideas as they come in. To ensure the reader finds the relation you intend, you must tell them in advance what it is.  

As you see above, **writing clearly is more about organizing ideas than writing words**. To write clearly, you must: 1) decide the points you want to make and 2) put them into words. That is, think first, write later. This process would also a) cut down the writing time, b) increase clarity, and c) decrease the length. In a group setting with multiple co-authors, aligning on the points you want to make before you put down the words reduces the time taken to arrive at an agreement and to create a coherent document.  

## The Pyramid Principle  
The brain's hierarchical information storage dictates that "writing clearly" follows a pyramid. 
The pyramid rests on two principles:  
1.	Every document can and should be reduced to a single main message.
2.	You should state this message as soon as possible, immediately after a short and suitably structured introduction.  

Success in "writing clearly" requires embracing both of these principles. In his excellent book on storytelling, [The Invisible Ink,](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Ink-Practical-Building-Resonate/dp/0998534471/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=invisible+ink+brian+mcdonald&qid=1671688566&sprefix=invisible+ink+brian+%2Caps%2C1309&sr=8-1) Brain McDonald calls the main message **the armature**. The armature is the skeleton on which the whole document or story stands. Without the structure, the body collapses. **In business writing**, unlike storytelling, **it is better to lead with the main message** so that the reader is not left in suspense.  

We often feel uncomfortable accepting the second principle of telling the message as soon as possible. We feel compelled to use an alternate structure of walking the reader through the analytical process that led to the answer. This alternate structure has two flaws. First, the reader must wait until the end to get the main message. Many readers may run out of steam before reaching the last page. Second, redundancy and repetition are inevitable in this structure. We will need to summarize findings frequently and return to the first areas to present conclusions. This starting, stopping, and starting forces repetition for the writer and places a cognitive load on the reader, causing impatience and inattentiveness.  

The pyramid avoids both the issues with the alternate structure above. It reflects the distinction between the analysis process and communicating the results. **To analyze, we think up, working from raw material to the main message. To express, we write down, from the main message to the detail**. 


## Structure of the Pyramid 
In the pyramid, you lead with the answer – the main message. You expand the pyramid vertically by answering the **why** and **how** questions raised in the reader's mind and explain your logic horizontally using deductive or inductive arguments. Thus, the elements in the pyramid have both a vertical and horizontal relationship. The first level of hierarchy from the main message is the key-line level. At this level, you must cover the "why" of the main message. Lower levels serve up the details supporting the key-line levels. The pyramid covers what teachers call the body of the document. The pyramid should be preceded by an introduction, describing what the reader will get and why they should care. 

The vertical relationship between levels in the pyramid reveals items in a question/answer format. For each statement or topic, the reader's mind constantly raises the "Why?" and "How?" questions. Hence the question/answer format should cover the "Why?" and "How?" from the previous level. **When both "Why" and "How" questions are likely, first answer the "Why" and then the "How".** Nobody cares how to do something unless they are convinced of its value.

The horizontal relationship follows deductive or inductive reasoning for all elements at the same level of the pyramid. The question/answer format dictates that the details at the following line of the hierarchy must logically answer the questions raised by the previous level. Hence these elements must be related with either a deductive structure or an inductive structure. The deductive structure has a major premise, a minor premise, followed by a "therefore" conclusion. The inductive structure has a special observation, pattern recognition, and a conclusion. This structure lends itself to grouping. I will cover the merits and application of these structures in the "How to Build the Pyramid" section.  

Writing an introduction is necessary because the reader is only interested in reading your document and knowing what you will tell them if they feel the need to do so. The introduction is the most important part to capture the reader's attention and motivate them to read further. To connect with the reader, the best way to write an introduction is to tell a story. Every good story has a beginning (the Situation), a middle (the Complication), and an end (the Resolution). The Resolution should be your main message.

An exciting implication of the question/answer dialogue is that it eliminates any logical need for a conclusion. Logically speaking, there is no more to say once all questions have been answered. But a conclusion creates a sense of closure; without it, we would have no place for the inevitable Next Steps. Nonetheless, there is no such thing as a structured conclusion.  

The pyramid principle is not just applicable to large documents. You can apply these to day-to-day chats and emails to land your message. I share below an chat dialog with Laura:
>>>**Laura:** *I have a question on "Field A" in System A. Is it equivalent to "Field B" in system B?*  
**My first draft:** *Yes, they are the same. There could be marginal differences in counts between systems due to the time when systems refreshed, but both systems source data from the same field in System C.*  
When I reviewed the draft, I found that although I had answered the first question, the following statement called out differences, then I switched back to saying they are same. So Laura would have to read: **same, different, and same**. Secondly, I first drew attention to the less critical element – the minor differences.  
**Revised response:** *Yes, they are the same. Both systems source data from the same field in System C. There could be marginal differences in the counts due to system refresh delays.*    
 

With the revised response, Laura could stop after the first or second statement and still obtain the complete picture. She also would not need to context switch between similar and different data.


## How to Build the Pyramid?
Now that we understand the importance and basic structure of the contents, a question arises, what is the best way to build them? Unlike physical pyramids, structured document pyramids can be created using either the top-down or the bottom-up approach.  

In most cases, **you should try the top-down approach first**. In a top-down approach, you think first, write later. This approach allows multiple stakeholders co-authoring a document to align on the messages before creating content. By focusing on the messages first, the approach reduces the tendency to showcase all the work done by each team. A top-down approach avoids the "get it all down" syndrome in single and multiple-author scenarios. *We love what we have created, no matter how disjointed the thinking.*  

For a top-down approach, you can use the following steps:  
1.	Write the Subject you are discussing.
2.	Visualize the reader. What question in their mind about the Subject would you answer when you have finished writing?
3.	In the top box of the pyramid, write the answer - the main message.
4.	Now think through the introduction. Identify the Situation. What does the reader already know about the Subject? What are the other undisputable facts on the Subject?
5.	Develop the complication. Ask, "So What?" What has changed in the stable Situation? What happened in the Situation to trigger the question?
6. Recheck the Question and Answer – the complication statement should immediately raise the question. If not, rethink and adjust as needed.
7.	What new question is raised by the answer?
8.	How will you answer it? Deductively or Inductively?
9.	Repeat the question-answer process to structure the support points.  

The bottoms-up approach is handy for presenting output from research or audit projects. In my experience, this approach takes longer, especially when multiple groups are involved, because it is challenging to decide what to cut. 
1.	List out all the points – problems, solutions, findings
2.	Work out the relations. The relations must fit one of the four analytical activities the brain can perform: working out cause and effect, dividing a whole into parts, categorizing, and reasoning deductively. 
3.	Draw the conclusions – the Situation, the Complication, the Question, and the Answer. Recheck the question and answer – the complication statement should immediately raise the question. If it does not, rethink and adjust.  

Do not omit to think through the introduction. Limit the introduction to what the reader will readily agree is true. Always put the historical chronology in the introduction. "What happened" should not be in the body. The body should hold only ideas.  

For each step in the hierarchy, we should know some finer points on how to do them well.

## Finer Points of Introductions and Relations
### Finer Points of Introduction  
An introduction should be long enough to ensure that you and the reader are "on the same page" regarding the **S**ituation and the **C**omplication before you lead the reader through the **R**esolution. Our brains process the emotional connotations of words much faster than we understand their meaning. As said earlier, good introductions have a story that connects with the reader. The best introductions have a story that invokes emotions like joy, trust, fear, and surprise. Since the introduction is a story, it is one of the best places to invoke emotions.  

While S-C-R are all needed, the order in which you introduce them depends on the tone you want in your document.  
- **Considered: S-C-R**. Most commonly used when you want to build up the story, especially if the reader needs to be convinced about the Resolution.  
- **Direct – R-C-S**. Applicable when most of the readers will most likely accept your Resolution but needs convincing.
- **Concerned – C-S-R**. Useful when the Resolution may not be complete or is open-ended.

The S-C-R framework was developed in the 1970s by consultants at McKinsey & Company. [How to tell a Business Story](https://speakingsherpa.com/how-to-tell-a-business-story-using-the-mckinsey-situation-complication-resolution-scr-framework) has a good list of papers using this framework.  

### Finer points of vertical relationships.  
The vertical structure of the pyramid answers the "why" and "how" questions raised in the reader's mind. To ensure reader attention, **you must refrain from raising questions in the reader's mind before you are ready to answer them. Similarly, you should refrain from answering questions that have not yet been raised.**  

Use positive words to communicate, especially when elaborating on the "why." Studies have shown that negative words induce a fight-or-flight response in the reader's mind. Negative statements, like "does not work" and "is not useful," speak in absolute terms, invoking examples of when these statements are invalid. [Negative Words to Avoid in Writing](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/negative-words-to-avoid-in-writing.html) article discusses the impact of negative words and the possible alternatives.

### Finer points of horizontal relationships
Horizontal relations at lower levels of the pyramid answer the "why" and "how" questions raised at earlier levels. Hence, they must logically explain the details using either deduction or induction arguments. With either approach, the hierarchy structure dictates that ideas at any level of the pyramid must always be summaries of ideas grouped below. All items within a group must follow the following rules:  
1.	Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind.   
Shortcut to check: Label the summary section with a plural noun. For example, group apples, oranges, and grapes as "fruits"; table and chair as "furniture." Depending on your storyline, grouping "fruits" and "furniture" as "objects" could result in a loosely formed group. Adjust the layers as needed to conform to this rule.  
2.	Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered. There are only four possible logical ways to order a set of ideas to match the four analytical activities that the brain can perform.
  -	**Deductively** (major premise, minor premise, conclusion) - reasoning deductively
  -	**Comparatively** (first most important, second most important, …) - categorizing.
  -	**Chronologically** (first, second, third) - working out cause-effect
  -	**Structurally** (alphabetical etc.) - dividing a whole into part

The deductive grouping has a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. A deductive structure is most useful when you must deliver bad news, and the reader is unprepared. The major premise, minor premise, and conclusion allow you to prepare the reader and gain their agreement before stating the conclusion. This reasoning poses significant challenges at the key-line level. The reader does not see the conclusion until the end; the reader may disagree with the major or the minor premise and never get to the conclusion. **A deductive structure is better at lower levels of the pyramid after the main and key-line messages have landed.**  

Inductive grouping will take a set of similar ideas as a group, and you state the inference based on commonality among the ideas. **Inductive grouping offers two major advantages for structuring the key-line message.** First, the logic is easy to follow. Grouping lends itself to enumeration and ordering, allowing you to control the narrative. Second, disagreement with one point does not doom the argument if the other points are strong. The inductive grouping has its pitfalls, but these are easy to overcome since you control the grouping and the narrative. Some common inductive grouping pitfalls are loosely formed groups, overlapping groups, or groups with elements at different levels of abstraction.  

### Finer points of titles and transitions.
Now that you have the introduction, vertical and horizontal structures, and the relations, it is time to work out the language details. The key to successfully translating the pyramid into a document or presentation is the effective use of topic sentences. Every chapter, section, or paragraph should have a topic sentence, and every topic sentence should perform two roles:
1.	State the single, most crucial point the reader should take away from that page, section, or paragraph.  
2.	Make a significant contribution to the overall story mapped by the pyramid.  

As you detail the parameters into chapters, sections, and paragraphs, you want to make your transitions between them smooth and non-mechanical. You want to relate the groups based on the main ideas contained in the group, not based on what they "do." The transition should look in both directions – reminding the reader what has been said and telling them where you are going. At the start of a chapter, section, or paragraph, use the technique of referencing backward. If the chapter is long, pause at the end and summarize before going on.

## Summary
The pryamid structure is forcing me to think about all the messages to convey before writing the document. As a result, how I write my chats, emails, or vision documents is changing. I am moving from "I don't like writing" to "I am enjoying writing." I found the following items most useful:  

-	Establish the main message you want to land. Use the top-down approach to build the pyramid and get stakeholders' alignment.
-	Use the Situation, Complication, and Resolution framework for introduction and revise the pyramid if necessary. Tell a story using the S-C-R framework, preferably invoking the reader's emotion.
-	Lead with the answer first. Then, state the key-line level using inductive reasoning. Follow with supporting information using deductive or inductive reasoning. 
-	In the question & answer process, refrain from raising questions you are not ready to answer. Also, do not answer questions that are not yet raised.
-	In inductive reasoning, list items using one of the following methods: comparatively (most common), chronologically, or structurally.  

I have not included detailed examples to keep the reading time of this article under 20 minutes. Please see the references section below for books and sites that include good examples of the pyramid and the S-C-R frameworks.
